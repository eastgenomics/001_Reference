A gzipped tarball containing the reference genome files genome.fa, genome.fa.fai and genome.dict.

These were extracted from Illumina's pipeline docker image TSO500_v2.0.0, which was decompressed and 
these 3 files recompressed and copied into 001 (\resources\genomes\hg19_hardPAR\).

This tarball is used by picard for various functions - they need to match the genome files used to create BAMs etc.

This tarball is specifically for running picard on TSO500 Illumina pipeline outputs.
